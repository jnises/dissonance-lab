# Dissonance Lab

![screenshot](docs/screenshot.webp)

Test at https://jnises.github.io/dissonance-lab/

Small gui to explore the dissonance of different intervals and chords on a piano.
Includes midi input and a simple piano synth implemented as a webaudio worklet.

The colorful rows above the piano show the interval for each other key when one or more is pressed.
The pressed keys are considered the root of each interval even when it isn't the lower note.


## Requirements
* Rust toolchain ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
* Trunk `cargo install trunk`

## Running

```
trunk serve --release
```
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/

Note that you need to manually unmute by clicking the ðŸ”‡ button. This is due to the browser autoplay blocking feature.

## Testing
```
./test.sh
```

You can't use `cargo test` directly since that would compile as wasm.
`test.sh` runs the tests as a native binary.
